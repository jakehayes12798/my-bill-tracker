# My Bill Tracker

A personal finance tracker built with **React + TypeScript**.  
The goal of this project is to create a clean, modern, and customizable way to manage recurring bills, forecast upcoming expenses, and stay on top of financial commitments.

This app is designed not only as a practical tool, but also as a showcase of my full-stack development skills, with a focus on:
- **TypeScript DTOs** for strong typing and reliability  
- **Reusable utilities** to handle core financial logic  
- **Clear separation of concerns** between data models, utilities, and UI components  
- A visually intuitive interface that makes bills, due dates, and forecasts easy to digest at a glance

---

## Features (Planned & In Progress)

- 📌 Add, edit, and delete recurring bills  
- 📆 See upcoming due dates on a timeline/calendar view  
- 💰 Track variances between expected vs. actual amounts  
- 📊 Forecast future expenses across months  
- 🔍 Filter and search for specific bills  
- ☁️ (Future) Sync with a backend for persistent data storage  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript  
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (planned)  
- **Build Tooling**: Create React App (TypeScript template)  
- **State Management**: (Planned – either Context API or Redux, depending on complexity)  
- **Backend**: Placeholder for now (likely Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL or SQL Server in the future)

## Why This Project?

Managing recurring bills often means juggling spreadsheets, reminders, and mental math.  
This tracker aims to provide a single, elegant interface for **clarity, control, and confidence** in personal finances.

It’s also a way to demonstrate:
- Clean coding practices in TypeScript  
- Scalable project structure  
- UI/UX thought process  
- Long-term vision for full-stack development
